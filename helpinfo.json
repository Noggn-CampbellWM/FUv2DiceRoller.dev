    "fuAbout": "*From www.perilplanet.com*\n*By Nathan Russell*\n\n***FU: the Freeform Universal RPG*** is a lightweight, super-flexible, super-fun roleplaying game that puts your characters at the centre of the action. It is a roleplaying game of action, adventure and fun! FU lets you quickly create characters, settings and situations with a minimum of fuss, or even preparation.\n\nThe core of FU comes down to this:\n\n• Characters are described with evocative descriptors – no “stats” or other numbers!\n\n• Only players roll dice, letting the Game Master focus on guiding an awesome story\n\n• Conflicts and obstacles are approached with closed questions – “Can I leap the chasm?” “Do I disarm my opponent?”\n\n• The dice answer your question with some combination of YES / NO / AND / BUT which you use to drive the story forward"
