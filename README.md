# FUv2DiceRoller.dev
FUv2DiceRoller.dev is the working build of a discord bot, designed to emulate dice resolution from the FreeformUniversal RPG from Perilplanet.com

If you want to try out the bot (and it's currently online) you can message FU Dice Bot#9180 on Discord.
You can also try out the bot at https://discord.gg/Tx6Qehr3ud as well as use the live version of the bot.  As of this time, the live version is, in the words of the caretaker, "A nameless abomination, a testament to my failures - it must be destroyed!"
